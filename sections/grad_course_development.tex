    \subhead{ECE1776: Computer Security, Cryptography and Privacy.} This is a new course that I developed for the graduate curriculum at the University of Toronto in 2004.  Because graduate students arrive with differing levels of experience, this graduate course gave basics and background in computer security as well as introducing students to the most current research.  The course contains lecture material, written assignments and programming assignments, oral presentations, and an independent project component. With the introduction of ECE568 in 2009, the course has now become more specialized on current academic research in security.
    
    \subhead{ECE1724: Industry Perspectives on Practical Problems in Computer Security.} Experimental course co-taught with Adjunct Professor Richard Reiner who has over a decade of experience in the computer security industry.  The course will educate students on practical aspects of computer security from the point of view of an industry practitioner.
