\textbf{CASCON Security Workshop}: Co-organized the CASCON Computer Security Workshop, which enabled security researchers from all over the nation to meet and network.  Over 100 researchers attended this one day workshop.  This workshop would go on to form the basis of the network of researchers that would apply for and receive federal funding for the Internetworked Systems Security Network (ISSNet).  

\textbf{ISSNet NSERC Strategic Network}: With 14 other Co-PI's
from across Canada, I successfully applied for funding for the
Internetworked Systems Security Network (ISSNet) Strategic Network
Grant.  The mandate of the network is to organize, guide and provide a
framework for security research across Canada.  The network is
organized into 3 themes: network-centric security, software-centric
security and human-centric security.  I am on the scientific executive
board and the leader of the  software-centric security theme.  My duties are to provide
guidance for other Canadian software security researchers, as well as
administrate the program funds.
